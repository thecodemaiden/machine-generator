The data includes the following variables; each column corresponds to one run:

o_final - the final population of the naive algorithm 
o_paths - the best fitness in each generation (row)

neat_best - the fitness of the best species in each generation for NEAT
neat_dist - the mean distance from starting genome for each generation for NEAT
neat_species - the number of existing species for NEAT

spneat_best, spneat_dist, spneat_species - similar to above but for spatial NEAT
