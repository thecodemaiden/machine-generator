TODO
----
	* Rename algorithms and mutators
    * Maybe make all possible mutators, then evolve the (choice of) mutations themselves?

NEW STUFF
---------
	* Spatial NEAT variant completely removes attachments rather than disabling them
    * There is only a 1/p_c chance that excess or disjoint attachments are added... BUT it causes inconsistency sometimes
	* Increasing simulation steps (simSteps) seems to make the algorithms behave a LOT better
